Description:
-------------
This program implements basic set operations in C++. The operations include:

Union (A U B)

Intersection (A n B)

Complement (U - A)

Set Equality (A == B)

The program allows the user to input elements of the universal set and two sets (A and B), and then perform the operations on them.
