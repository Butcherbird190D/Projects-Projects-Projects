Examiner Name: Gavin Barnes
Case ID: M57-Jean



Investigation: 
=============

Through examination, a timeline of emails has been formulated. The following email artifacts have been extracted from the outlook.pst directory: 
/img_nps-2008-jean.E01/vol_vol2/Documents and Settings/Jean/Local Settings/Application Data/Microsoft/Outlook/outlook.pst

SC-[x] refers to the respective screen captures under Case01-Jean-2008/Screen_Captures.

Timeline:
=============

2008-07-19 19:32:51 - Jean is contacted by an "alex" under alex@m57.biz, asking for financial projections. (See SC-1)

2008-07-19 19:39:57 - Jean is contacted by "Alison" under alison@m57.biz, requesting for a spreadsheet containing sensitive information of current and prospective employees, including full names, current salary, and SSNs. A "P.S." message is attached in attempt to cover traces of this conversation. (See SC-2)


2008-07-19 19:43:48 - After a brief clarification period, Alison realizes her email was changed to alex@m57.biz in a "misconfiguration" error. Her email is changed to alison@m57.biz but her username remains "alex". (See SC-3)


2008-07-19 19:50:19 - Verification of email address sent by Jean to Alison. (See SC-4)

2008-07-19 21:22:45 - Jean is contacted by tuckgorge@gmail.com (Non-trusted domain) under username alison@m57.biz regarding the aforementioned sensitive documents. Urgency is given by the contact. Surface level examination would fool one to believe that this is Alison. (See SC-5)


2008-07-19 21:28:03 EDT - m57biz.xls is created. Upon opening this sheet, an image is shown. Likely an attempt to hide information from investigation. (See SC-A, SC-B)

2008-07-19 21:28:00 EDT - Jean sends the documents to the contact. (See SC-6)

2008-07-20 21:17:54 - The contact confirms receiving. (See SC-7)

Verdict: 
=============

There are two likely cases:

Case 1: Alison purposefully changed her emails in order to cover her tracks in selling company secrets. 
-Causing confusion on email addresses purposefully (alex@m57.biz, tuckgorge@gmail.com) in order to maintain plausible deniability.
-This is still likely, but difficult to investigate further due to limitation of forensic analysis only to Jean's drive.


Case 2: Sensitive information leakage via spear-phishing attempts and email spoofing.
-The Alex email conundrum is due to a hacked email attack on Alison, opening up her email address for use by bad actors.
-The correspondence at 2008-07-19 19:39:57 EDT is the first sign of email theft and impersonation.
-The recovery of Alison's email address at 2008-07-19 19:43:48 EDT likely prompts the bad actor to make a more aggressive attempt.
-A major spoof attempt at 2008-07-19 21:22:45 EDT is likely a last ditch effort to complete the spearphishing scheme.
-Lastly, the chain of events leaves Alison within the right to deny ever requesting the documents or seeing any email correspondence regarding them, since it all took place under alternative email addresses Alison allegedly had no access to.

Conclusion:

Case 1 and Case 2 are still viable as verdicts. Being that both cases are mutually exclusive, forensic analysis of Alison's drive is required for confirmation of one over the other by analyzing what email accounts she has on her machine.
This being stated, current evidence shows bias toward Case 2 being true.
