Hi, Jean.

I'm sorry to bother you, but I really need that information now --- this VC guy is being very insistent.
Can you please reply to this email with the information I requested --- the names, salaries, and 
social security numbers (SSNs) of all our current employees and intended hires?

Thanks.

Alison</td>

		<td>Jean,


One of the potential investors that I've been dealing with has asked me to get a background
check of our current employees. Apparently they recently had some problems at some other 
company they funded.

Could you please put together for me a spreadsheet specifying each of our employees, their
current salary, and their SSN?

Please do not mention this to anybody.

Thanks.

(ps: because of the sensitive nature of this, please do not include the text of this email
in your message to me. Thanks.)</td>
