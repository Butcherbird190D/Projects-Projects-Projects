Examiner Name: Gavin Barnes
Case ID: M57-Jean



Investigation Overview

A forensic examination was conducted on the M57-Jean training image to assess potential unauthorized access and disclosure of sensitive company information. Email artifacts were extracted from the Outlook PST file associated with the user Jean. Screen captures referenced as SC-[x] correspond to images documented under Case01-Jean-2008/Screen_Captures.

The investigation focused on a sequence of email communications and spreadsheet activity that may indicate email compromise, impersonation, and attempts to obtain sensitive employee data.


Timeline of Key Events:
Date/Time (EDT)	Event
===================================================================================================================

2008-07-19 19:32:51	Jean receives an email from “alex” (alex@m57.biz) requesting financial projections. (SC-1)

2008-07-19 19:39:57	Jean receives an email from “Alison” (alison@m57.biz) requesting a spreadsheet containing sensitive information, including employee names, salaries, and SSNs. A P.S. message is attached, likely attempting to obscure the conversation. (SC-2)

2008-07-19 19:43:48	Alison’s email appears changed to alex@m57.biz due to misconfiguration or compromise. Her email reverts to alison@m57.biz, though her username remains “alex.” (SC-3)

2008-07-19 19:50:19	Jean sends verification to Alison regarding her email address. (SC-4)

2008-07-19 21:22:45	Jean receives an email from tuckgorge@gmail.com (non-trusted domain) under the alias alison@m57.biz, requesting the same sensitive documents. The urgency of the request suggests potential impersonation. (SC-5)

2008-07-19 21:28:03	Spreadsheet m57biz.xls is created. Opening the sheet reveals an embedded image, likely intended to obscure the content from review. (SC-A, SC-B)
2008-07-19 21:28:00	Jean sends the requested documents to the contact. (SC-6)

2008-07-20 21:17:54	The contact confirms receipt of the documents. (SC-7)

Analysis and Interpretation:


Two plausible scenarios were identified:

Case 1 – Internal Actor Manipulation

Alison may have intentionally altered her email addresses (alex@m57.biz, tuckgorge@gmail.com) to conceal her actions.
This scenario implies deliberate confusion to maintain plausible deniability.
Investigation is limited because analysis is restricted to Jean’s drive; Alison’s system has not been examined.

Case 2 – External Email Compromise and Spear-Phishing

The email activity suggests Alison’s account may have been compromised, allowing a malicious actor to impersonate her.
The correspondence at 2008-07-19 19:39:57 indicates the first potential unauthorized use of Alison’s email.
The subsequent restoration of her account at 19:43:48 may have prompted the attacker to escalate the attempt.
The 21:22:45 contact (tuckgorge@gmail.com) represents a further spoofing attempt to exfiltrate sensitive employee data.
Evidence supports the conclusion that the chain of events could allow Alison to deny involvement, as the activity occurred under compromised or alternate email addresses.

Conclusion:

Both Case 1 and Case 2 remain viable. Definitive determination requires forensic examination of Alison’s system to assess her email accounts and confirm whether activity originated from her or a third party.

Current evidence favors Case 2 (external compromise and spear-phishing) as the most likely explanation for the attempted disclosure of sensitive employee information.

Notes on Evidence Handling:

All artifacts were extracted from the provided M57-Jean training image.
PST email artifacts could not be directly tagged due to tool limitations in Autopsy 4.22.1; findings were documented via case notes and screen captures.
SHA-256 hash verification confirmed the integrity of the evidence images throughout analysis.
