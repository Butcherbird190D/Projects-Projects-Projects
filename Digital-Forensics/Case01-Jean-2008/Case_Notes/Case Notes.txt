Initial Date: 1/8/2026
Examiner: Gavin Barnes
Case ID: M57-Jean
System: Windows 11
Hostname: Gjbar
Evidence Source: Digital Corpora training image
Evidence Details: 2 pre-imaged disk images (E01 format)
Tools Used: Autopsy 4.22.1, FTK Imager 4.7.3.81, Eric Zimmerman Tools (June 2025)

Final Verification: SHA-256 hashes confirmed for all evidence images


Timeline of Activities:

1/9/2026 – Evidence Preparation & Initial Ingest

08:26: Downloaded E01 files (nps-2008-jean.E01 and .E02) from Digital Corpora to DFIR-A thumb drive. Hash verified using SHA-256.

08:34: Prepared DFIR-B thumb drive for evidence portability.

08:57: Created working copy of E01 files on local DFIR storage. Bit-for-bit verification performed; hashes matched published values.

09:11: DFIR-A drive ejected to maintain integrity.

10:00: Initiated Autopsy ingest on M57-Jean image. Data retrieval completed successfully.


1/10/2026 – Preliminary Analysis:

12:33: Reverified hashes of working image copies as a sanity check.

12:35: Identified main user of image as Jean.

12:43: Examined personal documents; online chat logs between Jean and Alison reviewed using EZViewer (Eric Zimmerman Tools).

12:55: Chat logs determined to be inconsequential to the investigation.

13:11: Initial email analysis indicated potential tampering with Alison’s email addresses. New actor (alex@m57.biz) appears to control communications previously under Alison’s account.


1/11/2026 – Email Artifact Analysis:

13:46: Email analysis confirmed prior email address compromise:

Alison’s email changed from Alison@m57.biz to Alex@m57.biz at 2008-07-19 19:31:00.

Emails sent at 2008-07-19 19:32:51 show requests for sensitive documents using Alison@m57.biz.

13:50: Email from tuckgorge@gmail.com requests background check documents from Jean.

17:50: All analyzed files, original copies, and supporting documents loaded onto DFIR-B thumb drive for secure portability.


Notes / Observations:

All evidence handling maintained forensic integrity through hash verification and controlled storage.

Autopsy was used to extract email artifacts; direct tagging of emails was limited due to PST artifact constraints.

Preliminary analysis shows signs of email compromise and potential unauthorized attempts to access sensitive documents.
